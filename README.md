# Design Challenge 4

Uses a Star Wars Character API to display a list of all of them

## Installation
With node installed on your computer, run the following commands once the repo is cloned onto your computer:

```
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
npm start
```

After, you can test the app on your phone by running one of the following commands, depending on what kind of phone you have.

iPhone:
```
npm run ios
```

Android:
```
npm run android
```

After, a new tab should pop up. In the bottom left corner, there should be a QR code. Change it from LAN to Tunnel, and then scan the QR code
*while the Expo app is installed on your phone*. Once it runs, the list should appear, with more added the further you scroll down.
